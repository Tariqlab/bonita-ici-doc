# Monitor cases

The Operation managment living application contains pages to monitor cases given their time prediction.

## The UI

The view is filtered by process and optionally its version.
It is composed by a pie chart that shows the ratio between cases late, predicted late and on time.
It also contains a list of cases that displays the percentile of cases that took the same path than the case and finished within the target defined, as well as the time remaining before the target duration.

You can click on a particular case to display its overview.
